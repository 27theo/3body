# Three body simulation: a Golang implementation

This is a throwaway project of mine attempting to simulate at least one
periodic orbit of the 3 body problem. I chose Golang for a quick and easy setup
and the simplistic and stripped-back 2d rendering library Ebitengine, as
opposed to wrangling with pygame or SDL.

I have so far attempted starting conditions from the following paper:

> Collisionless periodic orbits in the free-fall three-body problem.
> Xiaoming Li and Shijun Liao.
